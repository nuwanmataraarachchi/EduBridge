    <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12 pt-lg-5 justify-text">
            <p>The complex neurodevelopmental condition known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by persistent difficulties with social interaction and communication as well as the presence of restricted or repetitive behaviour patterns </p>

            <p>Children with ASD have special educational needs that frequently necessitate individualised strategies to support their learning and development. Exploring the potential of technologically based interventions, such as E-Learning Assistive Systems, to address the unique difficulties faced by children with ASD in educational settings has gained more attention in recent years </p>

            <p>The significance of this research lies in its focus on developing and evaluating an E-Learning Assistive System designed specifically for children with ASD. By utilizing interactive multimedia, adaptive learning techniques, and personalized feedback, the system aims to provide a customized and engaging learning environment.</p>

            <p>The study seeks to contribute to the field of assistive technology and inclusive education by enhancing our understanding of how technology can effectively support the educational needs of children with ASD. The findings will inform the development of evidence-based interventions, fostering improved educational outcomes and promoting inclusion for children on the autism spectrum disorder [4].
            </p>

            <p> The literature on technology-based interventions for people with ASD offers insightful information about the advantages and difficulties of their use. The potential of interactive and multimedia technologies to engage children with ASD and improve their communication and learning abilities has been highlighted in earlier studies</p>

            <p> ASD children's unique learning needs can be met by adapting educational materials using adaptive learning techniques. Additionally, studies on personalized feedback mechanisms have shown how well they help people with ASD learn new skills and improve their learning outcomes [5].
            </p>

            <p>The existing literature emphasizes the importance of providing individualized and engaging educational experiences for children with ASD [5]. E-Learning Assistive Systems have emerged as a promising avenue to address these needs. However, there is a need to further explore and evaluate the effectiveness of such systems specifically designed for children with ASD.</p>

            <p>The current study aims to build upon the existing literature by developing and evaluating an E-Learning Assistive System tailored to the unique requirements of children with ASD, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the potential benefits and challenges associated with its implementation [6] [7].

            </p>

            <p>While previous research has demonstrated the potential benefits of technology-based interventions for individuals with ASD, there are still knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. Existing studies have often focused on a broader population, neglecting the specific requirements and challenges faced by children with ASD. </p>

            <p> The current study aims to fill this gap by developing an E-Learning Assistive System tailored specifically for children with ASD. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the system's effectiveness and gathering feedback from both children with ASD and their caregivers, this research will advance our understanding of how technology can effectively support their educational needs. Additionally, by identifying any limitations or challenges encountered during the implementation of the system, this study will contribute to the refinement and improvement of future assistive technologies for children with ASD [1] [8]. </p>
